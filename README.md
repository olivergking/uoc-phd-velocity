Notebook with tools to accesses, sample, and compare satellite-derived image-pair ice velocity datasets from:
- ENVEO (Environmental Earth Observation IT GmbH)
- ITS_LIVE (Inter-mission Time Series of Land Ice Velocity and Elevation; NASA)
- GrIMP (Greenland Ice sheet Mapping Project; NASA)
- PROMICE (Programme for Monitoring the Greenland Ice Sheet; GEUS)

Rough validation is also performed against GPS-derived ice velocities.
